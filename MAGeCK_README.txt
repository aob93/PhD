# Guide to Running MAGeCK from a Log Example
# This guide is based on a log from a CRISPRa_v2_plasmid analysis using MAGeCK v0.5.9.2.

# Step 1: Environment Preparation
# Ensure that MAGeCK v0.5.9.2 is installed and accessible in your environment.
# If not installed, refer to the MAGeCK documentation for installation instructions.

# Step 2: Preparing Input Files
# Prepare your FASTQ file and sgRNA library file. In this example, the FASTQ file is named "AOB-CRISPRa-LIB_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz", and the sgRNA library file is "CRISPRa_v2_MAGeCK_library.txt".

# Step 3: Running the MAGeCK count Command
# The count command is used to process FASTQ files and map reads to sgRNAs. Execute the following command in your terminal:

mageck count --fastq AOB-CRISPRa-LIB_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz \
             -l CRISPRa_v2_MAGeCK_library.txt \
             -n CRISPRa_v2_plasmid

# Here, --fastq specifies the path to the FASTQ file, -l points to the sgRNA library text file, and -n sets the prefix for output files.

# Step 4: Understanding the Output
# During processing, MAGeCK will:
# - Load the predefined sgRNAs from the library file.
# - Parse the FASTQ file and determine the trim-5 length for read mapping.
# - Report possible guide RNA (gRNA) lengths and proceed to process millions of reads.
# - Provide mapping statistics, including total and mapped reads, and calculate size factors for normalization.

# Warnings and Info:
# - Be aware of any warnings, such as sgRNAs with duplicated sequences.
# - MAGeCK provides informative messages about the read processing stages and mapping statistics.

# Step 5: Reviewing the Results
# The command will generate several output files prefixed with "CRISPRa_v2_plasmid", including:
# - Mapping results and statistics of sgRNA reads.
# - Summary metrics like gini index and mapped read counts.
# - A report on sgRNAs not mapped by any reads.

# Step 6: Visualization and Further Analysis
# MAGeCK includes features for result visualization and further analysis. Although not shown in the log snippet, exploring these features can provide deeper insights into your CRISPR screen data.

# Note: This guide is a simplified overview based on a specific example log. Adjust file names and paths according to your project's setup.
